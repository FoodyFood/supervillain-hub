# Supervillain Hub

#### The only account a Supervillain Needs!

I wanted something fun to build in my downtime. I got the idea from watching Minions to make a hub for all us Supervillains! 

_How very evilllll.. muhaha.._


### URL 

[Supervillain Hub](https://supervillain.cloud/)


### Contents

Website is React.js/HTML \
Server is Extress.js \
Container is Node.js \
Deployment is via Helm Chart \
Infra is a Linode Kubernetes clsuter 


### Builds

Builds use GitHub workflows.

### Continuous Deployment

I'll try get FluxCD working for it at some point to save me restarting the pod each time a new image builds.


### Contribution/License

Feel free to fork, clone, or downright steal the code, we are supervillains after all. See MIT license. 

I make mistakes, so if you spot anything that I should fix for any reason like security or whatnot, point it out, I'll be grateful of the chance to improve!
