# This is the README that was generated for the supervillain project!

For ease of use, we have included a makefile with the most common functions.

Firstly, run this to build, upload, and deploy the project

```bash
make all
```

When once you have made some changes, and want to publish the changes run this

```bash
make update
```

of the website to GitHub, which is escentially OneDrive for the cloud.
