# Supervillain Hub

A hub for all your Supervillain Needs!

I wanted something fun to build in my downtime, and got the idea from watching Minions to make a Supervillain Guild!

## Contents

## Continuous Deployment

I'll try get FluxCD working for it at some point to save me restarting the pod each time a new image builds.

I make mistakes, so if you spot anything that I should fix for any reason like security or whatnot, point it out, I'll be grateful of the chance to improve!
